This HW is about using physcis informed neural netwrok to train a model. THis particuary solves the Buger's equation which is analytically difficult to solve.
Thios machine learning tool uses the boundary conditions at the boudary in the loss fucntion (custom_loss) along with L2 loss to optimize.

I have also tuened in the ANN/CNN in this repo.

Having to change the data shape even beofre training was the hardest part.
This time building the model and trainig it was the easiest part.

I mostly worked alone in this HW.

Important thing that I learned is -> how the optimization of the different fucntion can lead to different convergence points leadin to more suitable results for the analylically harder problem.
