I downlaoded the kaggle dataset  using
!kaggle competitions download -c higgs-boson

I use labels for classification and weights for the labels and regression for the weights of the particles.
I used Random Forest and a Gradiend Boosted Tree Classifier model to predict the label of the particles calculated the score of the model on the training and test set.

For this I mostly worked alone.
 Easy part to execute the code
 Hard part to know whats going behind the code and specifically when the model was overfitting.
