This homework assignment focuses on probability distributions and various properties to understand moments of the distribution, histogram, the Central Limit theorem, and establishing a relationship between the parameters of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and temperature.

I collaborated with Zach Savery on this project. We decided to work independently until the day of our meeting, where we mainly discussed surface-level concepts.

One challenge I encountered was when attempting to fit the sample means with a Gaussian function. I realized that providing initial parameters would help solve this problem. Another challenge I faced was understanding the relative frequency of the sample means. However, it started making sense when I realized that we were plotting it together with the probability density function (pdf), and the area under the pdf must be equal to one. In my case, it was approximately 0.05 * 40/2, approximating it with a triangle.
