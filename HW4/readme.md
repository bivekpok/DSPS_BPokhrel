## Dark matter and Galaxies
This HW was a reproduction from a paper by Vera Rubin
In her groundbreaking 1970 paper, Vera Rubin conducted a seminal study in which she investigated the rotational velocities of HII regions within various galaxies. Her research focused on how these velocities changed relative to the distance from the galaxy's center. According to our understanding of Newtonian gravity or General Relativity (GR), one would anticipate that once all of the mass within the galaxy is taken into account, specifically at radii beyond the galaxy's own extent, the rotational velocity should exhibit certain behavior.

I worked mostly individual but I chated ith Zach and Massoma for a the overall flow of the work

The hardest part for me was to figure out how to get the propagation of the error to the ration part and to understand the all luminous mass included.

The easiest part was typing in Latex  and data insertion.

In thsi HW I mostly learned the error propagation and the way to plot it effectively.
