This is the visualization assignment

 In the above picture, the change is sort of hidden as the every bar is plotted form y  = 0 therefore to see the changes writer couyld have started the y axis from somewhere in the middle of the y axis. So thhis is distorted plot and misleading so meaning the changes are not represented as it should be. It voilates the effect size factor.

This is the picture which is very good, the efect size, data/ink ratio, no chart junk is there in this picture.

This is another bad picture where the information is lost in the sense that the lower valued bars in the right most is under-represented, it would be better if the plot had log axis in y axis.



  These are my own plots:

In this plot there are few points with very less frequency that are hard to read.


Afterward, I log plotted the y axis and it looked much better interms of readability and use of the space.
