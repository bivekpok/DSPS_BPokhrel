This assignment was about the clustering (nsupervised learning where the goal is to group similar data points into clusters) problem.
I learned : 
K-Means Clustering: Divides data into K clusters based on the mean values of data points in each cluster.

Hierarchical Clustering: Forms a tree-like hierarchy of clusters by recursively merging or splitting them.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Groups together data points that are close to each other and have a sufficient number of neighbors.

Agglomerative Clustering: A hierarchical clustering method that starts with individual data points as separate clusters and then merges them iteratively.


I discused with Chirs and Jose for the assignment but all the part where done by me.

Easy: Read dataset and plot the dataset matrix.
Hard: to seperate the better clustering algorithm than the other ones, also DBSCAN is very sensesitive to the parameter (eps), I had to make several adjustments. ALso average linkage 
  dendograms are so trivial and cannot be used in this case.
