This is a reproducing the results from a coral 2018 earthquake paper.
THis talks about the scaling and plot the cumilative distribution with a dimensionless quatity of time gaps. KStest is performed to 
find the significance values.
Various data curation techniques are applied to filter the good data ( eg. within a time range sugested by author, removing to lagrge gaps, 
magnitudes less than 2).
