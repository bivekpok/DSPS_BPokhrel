It's great to hear that you successfully completed your homework involving Gaussian process modeling to interpolate and extrapolate sea temperature data over a 61-year period. Gaussian processes are powerful tools for curve fitting and modeling with uncertainty.
It's clear that you've gained valuable insights and experience in implementing Bayesian approaches and Gaussian processes.

Reflecting on the easiest and hardest parts of the assignment is a good practice. Optimization can indeed be challenging, and selecting appropriate initial guesses can make a significant difference in the success of the optimization process.

It's also commendable that you were able to work on most of the assignment independently while seeking help from peers when needed. Collaborative learning and problem-solving are valuable skills in any field.
Easiest part : To interpret the data and visaulize it.
Hard part : Optimiztion sometimes was tricky and I was getting error before untill I chang ethe initial guess.
I did most all my work alone althogh I chatted with Zach and Christian.
