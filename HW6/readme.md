This Hw was for using the Gaussian process model to interpolate and extrapolate the curve fitting using th edatapoints from the temperatuer oif the sea with time for 61 year from 1950 to 2010.
I extrapolated using the non stationary kernel  and interpoalte using staionary kernel.

Easiest part : To interpret the data and visaulize it.
Hard part : Optimiztion sometimes was tricky and I was getting error before untill I chang ethe initial guess.
I did most all my work alone althogh I chatted with Zach and Christian.
