This class is about the introduction of data science to the physicist, I am Bivek Pokhrel a graduate student working under Dr. Ed Lyman.

I thought this class can help me learn the coding and introduce me to the general data analysis skills helpful for my other projects as well.

ALthough I am new to this field of physics, my statistical backgroud can be helpful for me to understand the problem better and I believe that understanding the problem better is half solved.
