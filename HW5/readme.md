This Homework is the extension of the MCMC and the optimiztion techniques learned from the scipy for finding slop and intercepts.
I talked with Christain for this work. I took some help to complete the last few part of the code but I implemented my own varaiable and method.
Easy part : implementation of the scipy.optimization. minimize
hard part: getting to know if MCMC has worked or not.
