This hw is the intra week homework where we learned how to use the scipy.linear_model linear regression model 
and scipy.optimize minimize to see how the minimize produces similar result. 
I used L1 and L2 norm as the loss fucntion to optimize the single valued fucntion. L2 norm gave me more accurate result/closer
to the linear regression. This is true because the linear regression also applies the square of the mean error for its 
calculation.

The easiest part in this problem is to import and apply and this gibes the results within few linres of the code.

The hardest part was to figure out the meaning of the coefficeint as it was a two dimetional array, and I had to pick the second 
value corresponding to the slope of the fit.
